JS - CALLBACK
- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
- This technique allows a function to call another function
- A callback function can run after another function has finished

1. Sequence Control
- Sometimes you would like to have better control over 
when to execute a function.
- Suppose you want to do a calculation, and then display the result.
- You could call a calculator function (myCalculator), 
save the result, and then call another function (myDisplayer) 
to display the result:

function myDisplayer(some) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
}

function myCalculator(num1, num2) {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  return sum;
}

let result = myCalculator(5, 5);
myDisplayer(result);
